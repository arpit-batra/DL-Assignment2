1. First we need to create .npy files from the images of line data and seperate them for training and testing
2. This can be done by running 3.py
3. Then we can run the Sequential Convolutional networks with single head
4. 1.py for MNIST data for hyperparameters provided
5. 1_lines.py for Lines data for hyperparameters provided
6. 2.py for MNIST data for increasing the accuracy
7. 2_lines.py for Lines data for increasing the accuracy
